The exercise is meant to provide experience in DOM manipulation.

The apps asks the user to input as many tasks as needed.
Once tasks are listed, the user can erase them one at a time or choose to clear all tasks. Tasks are also saved to local storage and will continue to be on the list until disposed of. Tasks can also be filtered out by typing in a single letter, word or multiple words.
